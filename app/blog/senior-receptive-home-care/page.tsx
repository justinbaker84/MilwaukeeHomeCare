            If you're noticing changes in your senior loved one, like increased forgetfulness, not practicing their usual hygiene habits, missing doctors' appointments, falling behind on opening their mail, or paying their bills, it may be time for them to begin receiving home care.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suggesting to an aging parent that they need some help at home can be met with resentment and anger. They may insist that they&apos;re healthy enough to take care of themselves and are doing just fine with things as they are. However, if it&apos;s abundantly clear your aging loved one needs help, you may need to continue to pursue the idea with them before a major health crisis happens.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many families encounter resistance from seniors who are initially reluctant to receive the in-home care they need. Here are some proven ways you can help your senior loved one become more receptive to the idea of home care.
          </p>

          <h2>Focus on the positives</h2>

          <p>
            When talking with your parent about someone coming in to help, stress the positives. Instead of telling them the things they're no longer doing as well as they once did, reinforce the idea that having a caregiver will help them maintain their independence and continue enjoying their favorite activities. Emphasize that a caregiver will also be a source of companionship, not a source of control or limitation.
          </p>

          <h2>Make it about you</h2>

          <p>
            Parents often are more receptive to home care when they hear how their family is struggling with the situation. Let them know how much you're worried about them and how the stress is becoming increasingly difficult for you to handle. Many seniors don't like the idea of being a burden to their family and respond better if they see home care as benefiting their children.
          </p>

          <h2>Enlist outside help if needed</h2>

          <p>
            If you're not making much progress with your loved one accepting home care, you may need to ask for some help from people they respect. This can include their doctor, friends, neighbors, a social worker, or a religious figure (priest, minister, rabbi). Involving others can reinforce for your parent how important they are and how much people care about their happiness and well-being.
          </p>

          <h2>Start small</h2>

          <p>
            Having a caregiver slowly begin being part of their life can help a senior be more accepting of home care. Start by having the caregiver help around the house a couple of days a week in the beginning. Letting your loved one slowly get used to having someone new around the house can help them more quickly warm up to the idea of having their caregiver be there regularly.
