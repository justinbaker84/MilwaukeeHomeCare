            Studies consistently show that an overwhelming majority of older adults wish to age in place – at home – rather than relocate to a long-term care facility or nursing home. If your family member only needs assistance with daily living activities to maintain their independence, home care may be the right choice.
          </p>

          <p>
            While just about every adult wants to stay at home as they grow older, where they're independent and comfortable, it's essential to take some time before making a final decision if the staying home would be the right fit for your family member.
          </p>

          <h2>Here are three questions to consider before making this big decision:</h2>

          <h3>Does Your Aging Loved One Want to Age at Home?</h3>

          <p>
            One study performed by the American Society on Aging suggests that seniors value more than just remaining at home for convenience or comfort. Emotional attachment also plays a huge role in their desire to age in place. Almost two-thirds of seniors surveyed said their home's "emotional" value is more important to them than its monetary value.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, some seniors might prefer to leave their homes at some point. It's either to downsize to a smaller home, move in with younger family members, or eventually relocate to a senior-focused community. Others may move into a living situation with more on-site medical attention available.
          </p>

          <p>
            Talk with your loved ones about their preference. Being involved in the decision of a caregiver will make the transition to home care go smoothly from the start.
          </p>

          <h3>What Level of Care Does Your Family Member Need?</h3>

          <p>
            For many aging adults, non-medical home care is the right fit. Your loved one will receive the support and attention of a professional caregiver for however much time they need it. Some care recipients benefit from companionship services for just a few hours each week, while others prefer receiving assistance from a caregiver daily.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, some aging adults have medical needs that go beyond the scope of non-medical home care. They might benefit more by receiving care from a live-in nurse or another healthcare provider. And for others, assisted living might be the best choice if they require 24-hour medical care or attention.
          </p>

          <h3>Can Your Loved One Get Along With a New Companion?</h3>

          <p>
            It's important to consider how your family member might react to having a caregiver in their home. If your loved one is resistant to change or doesn't enjoy meeting and spending time with new people, this can make things more challenging for everyone. Some older adults equate receiving home care with an affront to their independence.
          </p>

          <p>
            It can help to talk this over with your loved one before bringing in a caregiver. Some people need a little time to warm up to the idea of home care. Involving them in selecting a caregiver is an effective way to increase the chances that they'll adapt to receiving assistance from someone outside of the family.
